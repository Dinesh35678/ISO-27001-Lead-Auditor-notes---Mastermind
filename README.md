# ISO 27001 Lead Auditor Notes (Full Detailed Explanation)

Covers Modules 1–5 from Mastermind syllabus. Beginner-friendly, in-depth.

## MODULE 1: THE BASICS

### 1. Background & History of ISO
- ISO (International Organization for Standardization) founded in 1947.
- Develops global standards for safety, quality, and security.
- ISO/IEC 27001: Information Security Management System (ISMS).

Versions:
- 2005: First version
- 2013: Updated
- 2022: Latest, modern focus on cloud, remote work, threat intelligence.

### 2. Accreditation vs Certification
- Accreditation: Approves certification bodies (e.g., NABCB, UKAS, ANAB).
- Certification: Audits organizations and issues certificates (e.g., TUV, BSI, DNV).
- Analogy: Accreditation = Judge, Certification = Examiner, Organization = Student

### 3. Multi-Year Audit Cycle (3 Years)
| Year | Type of Audit         | Purpose |
|------|---------------------|---------|
| 1    | Certification        | Stage 1: Documentation review; Stage 2: Implementation audit → Certificate issuance |
| 2    | Surveillance Audit 1 | Minor checks to ensure ongoing compliance |
| 3    | Surveillance Audit 2 | Confirm continued compliance, prepare for recertification |
| End 3 | Recertification     | Full audit again to renew certification |

### 4. Normative vs Informative Criteria
- Normative: Mandatory requirements – nonconformities can be raised.
- Informative: Guidance only – cannot raise nonconformities.

### 5. Revisions, Amendments, Corrigenda
- Revision: Major change (e.g., 2013 → 2022)
- Amendment: Medium updates
- Corrigenda: Minor corrections (typos, formatting)

## MODULE 2: UNDERSTANDING THE ISMS
