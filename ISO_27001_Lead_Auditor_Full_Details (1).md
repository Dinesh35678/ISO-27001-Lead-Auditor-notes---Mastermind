# ISO 27001 Lead Auditor Notes (Full Detailed Explanation)

Covers Modules 1–5 from Mastermind syllabus. Beginner-friendly, in-depth.

## MODULE 1: THE BASICS

### 1. Background & History of ISO
- ISO (International Organization for Standardization) founded in 1947.
- Develops global standards for safety, quality, and security.
- ISO/IEC 27001: Information Security Management System (ISMS).

Versions:
- 2005: First version
- 2013: Updated
- 2022: Latest, modern focus on cloud, remote work, threat intelligence.

### 2. Accreditation vs Certification
- Accreditation: Approves certification bodies (e.g., NABCB, UKAS, ANAB).
- Certification: Audits organizations and issues certificates (e.g., TUV, BSI, DNV).
- Analogy: Accreditation = Judge, Certification = Examiner, Organization = Student

### 3. Multi-Year Audit Cycle (3 Years)
| Year | Type of Audit         | Purpose |
|------|---------------------|---------|
| 1    | Certification        | Stage 1: Documentation review; Stage 2: Implementation audit → Certificate issuance |
| 2    | Surveillance Audit 1 | Minor checks to ensure ongoing compliance |
| 3    | Surveillance Audit 2 | Confirm continued compliance, prepare for recertification |
| End 3 | Recertification     | Full audit again to renew certification |

### 4. Normative vs Informative Criteria
- Normative: Mandatory requirements – nonconformities can be raised.
- Informative: Guidance only – cannot raise nonconformities.

### 5. Revisions, Amendments, Corrigenda
- Revision: Major change (e.g., 2013 → 2022)
- Amendment: Medium updates
- Corrigenda: Minor corrections (typos, formatting)

## MODULE 2: UNDERSTANDING THE ISMS

### 1. What is ISO/IEC 27001:2022?
- Framework to protect Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA).
- Guides organizations to build, operate, and improve an ISMS.

### 2. Applicability
- Suitable for any organization regardless of size, industry, location.
- Scope depends on business needs and risk assessment.

### 3. Focus in 2022 Revision
- Modern controls: cloud security, remote work, threat intelligence
- Controls reduced: 114 → 93 grouped into 4 themes
- Stronger risk-based approach
- Alignment with NIST, CIS

### 4. How to Read & Sequence ISO 27001
| Clause | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| 4      | Context of organization |

| 8      | Operation (control implementation) |
| 9      | Performance evaluation (internal audits, monitoring, management review) |
| 10     | Improvement (corrective actions, continual improvement) |
| Annex A| Controls reference (93 controls) |

### 5. Deciphering Auditable Requirements
- Auditable items: Clauses 4–10

- Must be clear, justified, documented

### 2. Risk Assessment Process
Steps:
1. Identify risks – threats & vulnerabilities
2. Analyze risks – likelihood × impact
3. Evaluate – accept/treat
4. Select controls – map risks to Annex A
5. Risk Treatment Plan (RTP)

### 3. Statement of Applicability (SOA)
- Lists all 93 Annex A controls
- Applied/not applied, justification, implementation status
- Mandatory; auditors verify accuracy

### 4. Planning Internal Audit
- Checks compliance, control implementation, effectiveness
- Include schedule, scope, criteria, methods, auditor competence

### 5. Top Management Review
- Reviews audit results, incidents, risk updates, objectives & KPIs, resources
- Ensures leadership involvement, continual improvement

## MODULE 4: PLANNING FOR THE AUDIT

### 1. Standards & Guidelines

### 2. Audit Team Roles
| Role             | Responsibility |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Lead Auditor     | Manages audit, assigns work, ensures quality |
| Auditor          | Collects evidence, evaluates compliance |
| Technical Expert | Provides specialized IT/technical knowledge |
| Observer/Trainee | Shadow, learn |

### 3. Application & Review
- Organization submits: scope, size, locations, complexity, audit time required
- CB approves/rejects before audit

### 4. Audit Program
- Covers 3-year cycle: Certification, surveillance, recertification

### 5. Annual Audit Plan
- Detailed plan: what, when, who, which clauses/controls to audit

## MODULE 5: EXECUTING THE AUDIT

### 1. Opening Meeting

### 4. Certificate Decision

- Lead auditor provides recommendation only

## Key Takeaways
1. Understand Clauses 4–10 deeply; auditable requirements
2. Follow: Risk Assessment → SOA → Control Implementation → Audit
3. Know roles, audit planning, 3-year cycle
4. Documentation matters: SOA, RTP, internal audit, management review
